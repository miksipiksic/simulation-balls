# simulation-balls

A Java program that uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a simulation of moving balls. The main features of the program are as follows:

1. Moving Balls: The program simulates multiple balls that move within a defined scene. Each ball has its own trajectory and velocity, and they move independently of each other.

2. Collision Detection: The balls interact with the boundaries of the scene and with each other. When a ball collides with the edge of the scene, it changes its trajectory, bouncing off the boundary. Similarly, when two balls collide, their trajectories may change based on the physics or game logic implemented in the program.

3. Pausing and Resuming: The simulation can be paused and resumed by pressing the 'SPACE' key. When paused, the balls stop moving, and their positions are frozen. This allows the user to observe the current state of the simulation or make adjustments without the balls moving.

4. Adding More Balls: While the simulation is paused, the user can add more balls to the scene. This is achieved by right-clicking on the scene, which triggers the addition of a new ball at the location of the mouse cursor.

Overall, this program is an interactive and visual simulation that demonstrates the behavior of moving balls within a defined scene. It employs fundamental principles of physics and collision detection to create a dynamic and engaging simulation experience. The user can control the simulation's progress, observe ball interactions, and introduce new balls to explore different scenarios.
